Test for firewall rule cleanup bugs.

Tests that:
1. Bug #1: Open mode firewall rules are properly cleaned up after container deletion
2. Bug #2: Firewall cleanup happens BEFORE container deletion (correct order)
3. No firewall rule accumulation across multiple container lifecycles

These tests verify the fixes for the bugs documented in ERROR.md from coi-pond.
